# Pipeline_of_Fraud_Detection_for_Banks
This is an integral pipeline(standardization document) of constructing lightgbm model  including preprocessing, parameter setting, train+predict_eval procedure,  and feature selection for transactional features of bank users to detect fraud,  available for current industry situations.

The intention is only used for my private use in my own work. Hopefully, it facilitates and speed up my working efficiency and performance. Due to confidential and privacy issues considering bank transactions, this doc is not suitable to publish public.
